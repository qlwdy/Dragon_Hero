The current name is Dragon Hero. 
The idea is very very basic mechanics like: walk, swing, dialogue, and maybe collect.
My focus is more on the vibe instead of the mechanics.
Since the theme is dragons specifically endless greed I was going to have there be a point where the character has to make a choice: go for more loot (being greedy) or leaving with what he has.
I was thinking the more he fails his checks while looting the closer he gets to waking the dragon. 
Failing the checks would wake the dragon and lead to him risking the dragon burning the whole village (yes this is from the hobbit desolation of smaug)
So the mini game is to fish out good loot in the room of loot filled with gold. The mechanic would work like this https://youtu.be/E4zQDs7kG4k?si=cXsLAV-ALI7sgXlA&t=61
Then if you fail and the dragon awakes you would have to win a dialogue check with the dragon to not get eaten yourself (maybe by having to remember what items you looted) emphasizing how greedy it is to keep going
